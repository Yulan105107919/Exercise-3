                The pie chart illustrates the distribution of various TV brands available in Australia, highlighting their market presence. 
                <strong>Samsung Electronics (11.78%)</strong> and <strong>LG (10.17%)</strong> emerge as the leading brands, reflecting their strong dominance and widespread consumer preference. 
                Following them, <strong>Kogan (8.24%)</strong> and <strong>Eko (8.20%)</strong> maintain a solid market share, suggesting they are also popular choices among consumers. 
                Brands like <strong>Philips (5.37%)</strong>, <strong>Hisense (5.23%)</strong>, <strong>Blaupunkt (5.13%)</strong>, and <strong>TCL (4.10%)</strong> contribute moderately to the market, 
                indicating they still hold a notable presence despite not being industry leaders. 
                Meanwhile, <strong>Sony (3.96%)</strong> and <strong>JVC (3.86%)</strong> account for a smaller share, which may imply they cater to niche markets or have a more limited availability. 
                Interestingly, the "<strong>Other</strong>" category makes up a significant <strong>33.96%</strong>, suggesting that numerous smaller brands collectively compete with the established names, 
                leading to a fragmented market. This distribution reflects a competitive TV industry in Australia, where both global giants and emerging brands vie for consumer attention.
